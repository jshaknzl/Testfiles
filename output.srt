Last year the smoking tire went on the bull run live rally in the

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:09,599
2010 Ford SBT Raptor. I liked it so much. I bought one. Here it is. We're going

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,179
back to bull run this year of course we'll help from our friends at Black

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,600
Magic and we're so serious about it. We got two Valentine one radar detectors.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,500
Oh yeah. So we're all set up and the reason we got two is because we're going to

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:29,920
be going a little bit faster. We got a 2011 Shelby GT500. The 550 horsepower

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,320
all-luminum V8. We are going to be right in the action bringing you guys a

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,880
video every single day live from the bull run rally July 9th to 16th and the

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,240
only place to watch it is on blackmagicshine.com or right here on the smoking

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,439
tire.
