00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,399
Last year the smoking tire went on the bull run live rally in the

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:04,639
2010 Ford SBT Raptor.

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:05,879
I liked it so much.

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:07,119
I bought one.

5
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:08,359
Here it is.

6
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:09,599
We're going

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,890
back to bull run this year of course we'll help from our friends at

8
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,179
Black

9
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,890
Magic and we're so serious about it.

10
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,600
We got two Valentine one radar detectors.

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,566
Oh yeah.

12
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:21,533
So we're all set up and the reason we got two is because we're going

13
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:23,499
to

14
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,640
be going a little bit faster.

15
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,780
We got a 2011 Shelby GT500.

16
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,920
The 550 horsepower

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,120
all-luminum V8.

18
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,320
We are going to be right in the action bringing you guys a

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,100

21

tire.
