00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,339
Last year the smoking tire went on the
bull run live rally in the

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:08,759
2010 Ford SBT Raptor. I liked it so
much. I bought one. Here it is.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,519
We're going

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,119
back to bull run this year of course
we'll help from our friends at Black

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:17,480
Magic and we're so serious about it. We
got two Valentine one radar detectors.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,179
Oh yeah. So we're all set up and the
reason we got two is because

7
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:23,480
we're going to

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,739
be going a little bit faster. We got a
2011 Shelby GT500. The 550 horsepower

9
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:34,200
all -luminum V8. We are going to be
right in the action bringing you guys
