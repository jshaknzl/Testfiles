00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,960
Welcome to the spine specialist and to our segment.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,080
Nice to know today once again, a quick explanation.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,800
What's the difference between a paresis and a plegia?

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,720
Before we get into the difference, let's first define
the term paresis.

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,919
Paresis is actually just the Latin term for paralysis.

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,039
And in a neurological exam, not all paralysis is the
same.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,759
We actually divide it into five strength levels, which
help us better classify the paralysis and make an

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,320
assessment.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,780
This strength grading system is named after janda.

10
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,299
There are five strength grades.

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,979
We say five out of five for full muscle strength and
zero out of five when there's basically no movement

12
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:37,299
left.

13
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:40,179
Five out of five means the patient has full strength.

14
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:44,020
Basically, 100% muscle function is present.

15
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:49,539
With four out of five, the patient can still move
against greater resistance with three out of five

16
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,299
only if the resistance is removed.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:59,440
Two would be when movement is possible only against
the weight of the limb itself, but can still be performed.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,959
For example, in foot drop, the patient can just barely
lift the foot a little, but there is no resistance

19
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,239
that needs to be overcome.

20
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,160
One out of five means even that is gone and only minimal
muscle strength remains.

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,200
And zero out of five would mean not even a contraction.

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,600
In other words, complete lack of strength.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,500
Now, the difference compared to plegia describes complete
paralysis, meaning the patient cannot move the affected

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,620
body part at all, unlike the previously mentioned
paresis.

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,019
With paresis, depending on the degree, you can still
see a bit of movement.

26
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:36,018
