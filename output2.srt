1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,240
Oh yeah.

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,519
Every week I get emails from you guys asking about cheap cars.

3
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,199
Now whether it's a thousand dollars, five thousand dollars, whatever it is, you're always

4
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,679
asking me, where can I get a good car for cheap?

5
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,439
Today we're going to talk about one of those places.

6
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,799
Now we've got this ridiculously pimping El Dorado right here.

7
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,119
And we've got these guys.

8
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:39,119
This is Chris and George.

9
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,119
Come on over guys.

10
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,119
Good to see you.

11
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,119
Good to see you.

12
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,879
Thank you for letting me try out your Cadillac.

13
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,920
These guys are from Cars4Gran.com.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,280
Now tell me about what is Cars4Gran.com other than the very obvious name.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,280
It's the very obvious man.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,120
We founded it in 2007.

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,120
Just kind of on a lark.

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,920
Just looking at, I mean I'm into old cars.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,719
We're just kind of cruising around eBay and Craigslist and looking at cars and thinking

20
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,520
it would be cool if we had one place where we could kind of gather all those listings.

21
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,280
So we started up Cars4Gran and pulled listings from eBay and Craigslist and Cars.com and

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
all over the internet.

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,640
And then we also set up a free classified service so people can post Cars4FREE and this

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,200
is kind of taking off on us.

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,079
Has it done well if you guys managed to get a lot of people buying cheap cars or what?

26
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,079
Totally man.

27
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,079
We sell about ten cars a day.

28
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,079
Do you really?

29
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,079
Yeah.

30
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,079
All for under a grand.

31
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,079
All for a grand or under.

32
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,519
Any good feedback from people?

33
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,159
Are they actually buying usable functional cars?

34
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,159
All the time.

35
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,000
We were getting emails from people saying how they couldn't get to work and they needed

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
a cheap car.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,640
They looked at us up and they found a cheap car to use for work.

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,920
Tell me about this L-Doh because this thing is actually quite pimps.

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,120
So we found this thing in a garage or in like a guy's barn in Thompson Illinois which is

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,719
this tiny little town about 150 miles west of Chicago.

41
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,719
And we kind of cruised around.

42
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,920
We saw a bunch of cars in Chicago that would have probably worked.

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,920
They got us down Route 66 when we saw this.

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,640
So tell me more about this car because I just drove at about 50 feet and it's awesome.

45
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,439
It's a 1973 Haldrodda.

46
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,439
Yeah.

47
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,439
454.

48
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:07,240
Well it's got 73 so it's got to make like 160 horsepower out of that right?

49
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,240
Maybe.

50
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,039
I mean I changed spark plugs on which gave a little more horsepower.

51
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,400
I changed the tripper cap which gave a little more juice and she's rocking it about

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
eight miles a gallon.

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
That's front wheel drive isn't it?

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,400
It's a little torque steer on it for the perfect for the snow.

55
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,120
It's going to be great.

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Does the top work?

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Yes.

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
It does.

59
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
Is it a power top?

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Yes.

61
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
And it works.

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
What does that count?

63
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,120
It's like half a crank.

64
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
It starts.

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
It does now with that new battery.

66
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
Oh yeah.

67
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
There you go.

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,920
It's a bit weird.

69
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,879
That is American muscle right there.

70
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,879
Absolutely.

71
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,879
Front wheel drive is it maybe?

72
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,200
They don't make them like that anymore.

73
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,719
Well I think we should we got to go for ride.

74
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:50,960
We got to see what a thousand dollars gets you in the world of Cadillac.

75
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Absolutely.

76
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Let's do it.

77
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:16,439
He thought load is going to really take up the dip.

78
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,439
Flat.

79
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,439
I'm going flat.

80
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,439
Oh it's not bad.

81
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,439
Not bad at all?

82
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,560
No it's not bad at all.

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,560
This is fine.

84
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
Yeah.

85
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,079
Tranny's good.

86
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,919
It shifts smooth.

87
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,560
It's not fast but it'll it it's not unsafe.

88
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
Nope.

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
It's got four big guys in already.

90
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,360
I've driven brand new economy cars that are slower than that.

91
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Like a Prius.

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,000
Like a Prius for example.

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,520
And how much is a Prius cost?

94
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
That's right.

95
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
So you talk about it?

96
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Right.

97
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
And you got a thousand.

98
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,120
You got 25 grand for gas.

99
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,320
And that'll take you what about a month to catch up?

100
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Exactly.

101
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:59,840
Let's do a little Santa Monica cruising and see the dice just makes it too.

102
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,520
Well the dice came with it actually.

103
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Him.

104
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,760
This is what California cruisans all about.

105
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,640
I haven't driven a land yacht convertible since I moved to California.

106
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
Where are you from?

107
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
New York.

108
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,960
I feel like I've been missing out now.

109
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,360
This is like this is the the move here.

110
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,240
I tell you what anytime you want to come down to San Diego you can ride it around.

111
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Oh for sure.

112
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,639
You got a permanent rental free rent.

113
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,160
Maybe for a track day.

114
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
Anytime.

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,720
Do this car.

116
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,240
It goes just fast enough for California.

117
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,519
You don't need to go faster than 35 in California ever.

118
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:40,240
The real problem with a car for a thousand dollars though is you're kind of walking on

119
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,800
eggshells with it aren't you?

120
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
Well yeah it depends.

121
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,079
We had kind of a specific goal in mind but I mean you know now that we're done with the

122
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,879
goal ship we can go and do brake stands on this thing all day long.

123
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,879
I don't care.

124
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,920
A front wheel drive brake stand in this would be pretty funny.

125
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,960
But since you have to get to San Diego I won't risk breaking your car.

126
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,680
But yeah I know I'm considered like that.

127
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,720
Unless it's a rental car then forget it.

128
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,879
If I was heard you would have any fault.

129
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,879
No no no.

130
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,960
You know I got to say it drives fine.

131
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,960
It really there's nothing about it that's like this is a broken car.

132
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,639
It's just it's a fine car.

133
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,759
It's not perfect but it works.

134
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,879
Dude if you can find works for a thousand bucks.

135
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,399
You know what I mean?

136
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,279
Works is the best you're going to hope for for it.

137
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,680
Works and character I'd say.

138
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,919
It's just set up for Pimpin.

139
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,919
Like it's pre-pimpin.

140
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,319
You don't have to do anything with it.

141
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,319
It's great.

142
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,159
They want to do it in the 70's just to be able to roll off a lot but immediately go Pimpin.

143
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,159
Oh yeah.

144
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,359
It's boring as much man.

145
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:41,639
This car I mean this car has got to be within a few inches of a suburban's length right.

146
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,639
This thing is massive.

147
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,639
I don't want to say it's longer.

148
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,639
You think it's longer?

149
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,639
Yeah it's a big car.

150
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,240
If anyone there knows the overall length of a 73 L though compared to a suburban let us

151
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,839
know in the comments because I'd like to see a comparison.

152
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,839
It's great.

153
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,719
Cars with character for those of you at home watching.

154
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:02,919
Cars with character are much better with the ladies than a Ferrari even right?

155
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,919
I mean I'll trade this for a Ferrari if you want to trade.

156
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,879
By comparison actually we've got the ultimate expression of character and shipboxness right

157
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,879
here.

158
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,199
We've got a 78 looks like Aston Martin V8 Vantage Vellante.

159
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,199
Wow look at that.

160
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,199
Isn't that beautiful?

161
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,199
That's a beautiful.

162
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,319
One of the best shapes to come out of England ever that car.

163
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,480
Such a piece of junk but so awesome to look at.

164
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
It's beautiful.

165
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,719
Today we're going to take it back to say hey we do all this interior.

166
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:29,719
Yeah.

167
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:32,159
You little bodywork does this little dent in the fender.

168
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:36,680
You want to redo the interior with like picnic basket plaid cloth.

169
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Awesome.

170
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,680
Right?

171
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,920
So the interior would be about 10 times the price of the car.

172
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Absolutely.

173
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,360
What we're going to do in Tijuana probably better say.

174
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,120
Do they have interior shops in Tijuana?

175
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,120
You can't even expect to be the only industry besides cocaine smuggling.

176
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
Is that the secret?

177
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
Yeah.

178
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
Get your interior done in Tijuana?

179
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
The bodywork done too.

180
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Now that's interesting.

181
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Yeah paint all that.

182
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,319
You can get all that done done there.

183
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,319
We got a hood.

184
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,319
It's our coat on paint, George.

185
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,319
Thousand.

186
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,560
Thousand for all the bodywork, all the debts, everything, all the rust and the paint.

187
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
Wow.

188
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
For a thousand bucks.

189
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,839
Oh, so for two Gs you are so golden right there.

190
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,959
Yeah, two Gs do the interior, do the body.

191
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,959
Whoops.

192
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:15,959
It's this car is...

193
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,959
There's a suburban.

194
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,959
There's a suburban.

195
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,680
Do you want to go?

196
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
Look.

197
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,920
Yeah, this is totally bigger than that thing.

198
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Way bigger than that.

199
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Totally bigger than the suburban.

200
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Maybe it just looks bigger because we're sitting in it.

201
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,120
No, I'm telling you it's bigger.

202
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,800
So if somebody wanted to buy this car off you, is it for sale or not?

203
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,920
I mean, it's not for sale at this point.

204
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,080
I mean, after you go through so much with the car, you just form a bond, man.

205
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
I know.

206
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,879
It's more valuable than the money, though.

207
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,879
Yes.

208
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,160
George, thank you guys for sharing your thousand dollar car with me.

209
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
This was awesome.

210
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,720
Perfect California car, am I right?

211
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Absolutely.

212
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,120
I kind of want to buy it off you.

213
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,520
I don't know if we can do that one.

214
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
I'm really tempted to.

215
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,319
I'm going to have to sleep on that.

216
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,319
You know what?

217
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,319
You'll find me another one for a thousand bucks.

218
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,319
I'll buy it.

219
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,319
We'll do.

220
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,920
I'll tell you what, if you guys have been a fine discremened deal on a car, they're out

221
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
there.

222
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Believe me.

223
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Leave a comment.

224
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,840
Let's see how far a thousand dollars or two thousand dollars would go.

225
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,920
That's Chris and George, cars for grand.com.

226
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
I'm Matt.

227
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
You've been watching The Smoke Entire.

228
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:19,640
I'll see you guys next week.

229
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,840
This year, Blackmagic sending us on the 2010 Bola and Live rally from July 9th to 16th

230
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,000
New York to Las Vegas.

231
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,759
We're going to be driving the 2011 Shelby GT 500 convertible.

232
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,680
Now ours is going to be red, but it's not out yet.

233
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,359
So you got this beautiful 2010 instead.

234
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:40,399
Here's your chance to come hang out with us, the Bull Run launch party in New York.

235
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,799
All you do is go to blackmagicshine.com and design your own racing livery using the tools

236
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,799
they give you.

237
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,799
I did it myself.

238
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:48,799
It's not that hard.

239
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,120
Goldberg is going to choose the winner.

240
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,239
And the best design ends up on our car for Bull Run and Blackmagic is going to pay for

241
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:57,599
your trip to New York to come hang out with us at the kickoff party.

242
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:02,679
So go to blackmagicshine.com and be sure to watch all our videos almost live from the Bull Run

243
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,679
rally right here on the Smoking Tire.

244
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,159
It's like Walmart had a sale on here.

245
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,159
It's a Fob Jaina.

246
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,159
I don't know what else to call it.

247
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,439
We can even binge the earth to its will.

248
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:15,519
This car is impossible to drive slowly.
