00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,419
Today is a fan appreciation day on the smoking tire.

2
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:15,960
Now Tom thinks that if we release all these balloons out of the back of this outback,

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,800
from the highest point we can find in LA, someone's going to find one, it's going to have

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,019
my business card on it, and they're going to call me up and I'm going to give them

5
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:24,019
a way of t-shirt.

6
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:27,100
One of the odds that someone actually finds a balloon in LA.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,300
You got five balloons.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,299
Alright, I'm so convinced this isn't going to work.

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:39,299
I'll tell you what, this balloon with the heart on it, I will put a little extra something on it.

10
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:47,299
Tell you what, if any of you guys find this white balloon, I will attach in addition to t-shirt,

11
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:50,299
I'll give you guys a date with my girlfriend.

12
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,299
How about that?

13
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,299
So I'm going to write Tracy.

14
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,299
Date.

15
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,299
So if you find this balloon, I'll give you a date with my girlfriend.

16
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:12,299
We got plenty of space in the back of the outback here, so getting all these balloons in really shouldn't be a problem.

17
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:21,299
Oh, almost.

18
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:30,299
Okay.

19
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,299
Setting off balloons would be silly if we didn't have a car to talk about, so here's the car.

20
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:55,299
2010 Subaru Outback, 3.6R model, and the R does not stand for racing.

21
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:02,299
In fact, I don't know the first clue what it stands for, but the flat six makes 256 horsepower 247 pound feet of torque,

22
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:07,299
which is good enough to make this thing go 0-60 in 7.5 seconds.

23
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:10,300
Not bad, but certainly not sports car numbers.

24
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,300
It's important when you're driving a car like this to kind of manage your expectations.

25
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,300
For instance, if I get in this car expecting it to be sporty because at the top of the line trim,

26
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,300
I will find myself sorely mistaken.

27
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:30,300
The car is set up to do the kind of driving that an outdoorsy person would do in a place with snow,

28
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,300
maybe some dirt, and some potholes, and what that means is the suspension is nice and squishy.

29
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,300
Lots of body roll in the corners, but this thing absorbs bumps like no road car I've ever driven.

30
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:50,300
The Outback has grown significantly in size for the 2010 year, and although it looks like a big, almost crossover from the outside,

31
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,300
what that means is you get a lot more space on the inside.

32
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:01,300
Front and rear headroom and legroom are superior, as is the gigantic amount of trunk space you have in this thing.

33
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,300
It will hold as much as your average SUV, no problem.

34
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,300
Originally, Subaru launched the Outback as the world's first sport utility wagon,

35
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,300
and what I take that to mean is you can do everything that a sport utility vehicle can do,

36
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,300
but without a lot of the headaches of driving around a big truck.

37
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,300
And that's really what this car feels like. It feels utilitarian. It's not an enthusiast car.

38
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:32,300
It's a car that's going to help you get your stuff done, no matter what kind of terrain you have to drive over.

39
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:39,300
As we pull onto this dirt road here, we're going to find out how this thing does once the road gets a little bumpy.

40
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,300
The Outback's squishy suspension, where it might be too squishy to carve the canyons,

41
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,300
is actually just about right for rough pavement or dirt roads.

42
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,300
And this car absorbs these bumps really, really well, and allows you to just point it wherever you want,

43
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,300
let the symmetrical all-wheel drive do its job and keep you in line on these dirt roads.

44
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,300
Not all as well in the world, unfortunately, there are quite a few things about this car that I really don't like.

45
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,300
The biggest glaring fault with this car is its throttle response,

46
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,300
whereas many manufacturers are using a throttle by wire systems now.

47
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,300
Subaru has introduced its new throttle by carrier pigeon systems,

48
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:25,300
which means if you hit the gas, you let a bird go and maybe the car will decide to accelerate.

49
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,300
The car doesn't do anything at all for a full half second after you touch the gas,

50
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,300
and then it gives you too much power. It's really, really annoying.

51
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,300
The other thing is, the engine, although it pulls this car acceptably,

52
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,300
it doesn't really sound very good. You can flat-six, you can Porsche, racing, that kind of stuff.

53
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:51,300
None of that with this car. Honestly, it sounds more like a late 80s American V6 than a Porsche engine.

54
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,300
It sounds like there's sand running around on the engine,

55
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,300
and just makes this harsh kind of noise when you drive.

56
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,300
The Outback starting price of $23,000 is perfectly reasonable considering the car's space and capabilities.

57
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:14,300
It's really a great value, but our $34,000 test car has all kinds of upgrades that I actually don't think fit the bill.

58
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,300
The nav system works, but it's not very intuitive.

59
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,300
You have to hit the disclaimer every time you use it, and the iPod interface is terrible.

60
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:29,300
How is it going to recognize that I'm plugging in an iPod and yet not show me track or artist names,

61
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,300
or any kind of information about the music? It's silly.

62
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,300
While the steering wheel and seats are upholstered in nice leather,

63
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,300
the top of the dash and all these things are hard plastic, and what really bothers me, listen to this.

64
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,300
What really bothers me is the shifter, which makes this horrible noise, and I'll stop and listen.

65
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,300
Here we go.

66
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,300
You hear that? Even with the soft touch plastics on there,

67
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:03,300
that's still a pretty cheap sounding racket that comes from a shifter in a $35,000 car.

68
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,300
The last thing I don't like about this car is the useless miles per gallon gauge,

69
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,300
which is really just an inverse throttle position gauge.

70
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,300
Of course, my gas mileage is going to suck when I'm flat out.

71
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,300
Show me a number I can actually use.

72
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,300
The bottom line on the outback is this. At a base level, it's a fantastic value.

73
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,300
But once you start loading in the options, its value goes out the window really quickly.

74
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,300
My advice? Buy a base model and get the extra stuff you need yourself.

75
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,300
Oh, this is a good spot. Let's launch some balloons.

76
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
I don't know exactly where we are, but look at this view.

77
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
Look at the value right there.

78
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,300
The first ever Smoking Tiger balloon launch, as I said at the beginning of the show,

79
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,300
if you find one of my business cards on a set of balloons, call me up,

80
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
and I will send you a t-shirt.

81
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,300
You've only got four sets of balloons. This is never going to work.

82
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,300
There's one. Clear the power lines.

83
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
All right.

84
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Oh my god. There goes another.

85
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,300
Number three.

86
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Bye-bye.

87
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,300
Is it going to clear? Oh, they're cruising.

88
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,300
Here we go. As I said before, I've included the win-a-date with Matt's girlfriend,

89
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,300
balloon here. Hopefully this one will get past power lines too.

90
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,300
Come on, baby. Rise.

91
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,300
Let's see if any of you guys actually call me.

92
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,300
All right. Let's go back to LA.

93
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Who is it? All right.

94
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,300
Hello. Hello.

95
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,300
Hello.

96
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,300
I don't know my son. How are you?

97
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
I'm Blake Shombler-new.

98
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,300
Andre? How you doing, man?

99
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,300
I'm doing great. How are things with Tracy?

100
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,300
Oh, Tracy's okay. Why? What's going on? What's up?

101
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,300
I just see about these meetings spent together,

102
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,300
and we have spent a great time, you know,

103
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:29,300
and I'd like to see how your girlfriend is doing. That's your thing.

104
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,299
I mean, she's okay. She's doing a thing.

105
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:38,299
Great. So when do I come in a collector?

106
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,299
What do you mean?

107
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:44,299
When do I come and collect my prize, which is...

108
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:48,299
Your girlfriend, not your girlfriend, Tracy.

109
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:50,299
What do you mean?

110
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:55,299
I find something that belonged to you that come down from the sky in the shape of a balloon.

111
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:59,299
So it's a collect Tracy date.

112
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:04,299
So I go to collect the Tracy date.

113
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:09,299
I'm going to have to call you back on that one, dude.

114
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,299
Hello.

115
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:17,299
He hung up, but I still want to collect Tracy date.

116
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:20,299
And right now, it's time for celebration, huh?

117
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:23,299
I think we have good time, me and Tracy.

118
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:26,299
Hello.

119
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:31,299
But I think we have nice time, me and Tracy.
